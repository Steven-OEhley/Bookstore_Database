# Bookstore_Database
This project uses Python and Sqlite3 to create a SQLite database and allow the user to create, modify and delete entries. 

The script is commented and labelled for easy reading. 

The script begins by importing the necessary modules:
  - sqlite3
  - os
  
The script then initialises a database setup.   
If the database has already been setup and the script finds a database file - this step is skipped.    

Initial dummy data is added to the database. 

The script then goes on to build out functions that would aid the user in interacting with the database.   
The user will be able to add/enter, update a specific or all features of a book and delete books from the databse. 
The user can also query the database based on the stock. 

This project allowed me to work with Python, the OS and sqlite3 modules.
